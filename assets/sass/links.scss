Links are formatted blue by default and are not underlined. When a mouseover is used, they become red.

There are two exceptions to this rule:
If there is a link in the running text, the linked text is underlined. Links in a navigation element (e.g. in the global navigation) are gray, and not blue. There are separate descriptions of how these special links are presented and how they behave at the appropriate places in these Web Guidelines.

You can  use the `.icon` classes to add some icons after or before the link. Use `.icon--external` if the link is external.

```html_example
<p>An <a href="#">internal link</a> in a paragraph.</p>

<p>An <a href="#" class="icon icon--after icon--external">external link</a> in a paragraph.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="icon icon--before icon--cart">link with icon</a></p>
<p><a href="#" class="icon icon--before icon--pdf">link with icon lorem <span>(PDF, 43 pages, 2Mb, English)</span></a></p>
```
