A drop down list box allows the user to select an item from a predefined list. This list appears in a menu after the element has been clicked on. After the selection has been made, the result is displayed.

With more than 10 options in the select, a search field is setup at the top of the dropdown list.

You can also add the `multiple` attribute to `<select>` and allow the user to select more than one option at a time, displaying them as tags in the input field.

```html_example
<select id="dropdown" class="form-control">
  <option>Option 1</option>
  <option>Option 2</option>
</select>
```
