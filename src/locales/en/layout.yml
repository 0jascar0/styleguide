      You can use `.form-horizontal` on `<form>` to display the label aligned at the left of the input. `.form-group` then behaves like a `.row`.

      Input boxes allow the user to input content (e.g. name).
      For inputting dates, an HTML5 solution is available. With browsers that do not support HTML5 the date has to be input manually.
      The following has to be taken into account for barrier-free accessibility:
      The name of the form and the form box must be linked to a label. A label ID may only appear once on a page. Required fields must have sensible names or, preferably, use WAI.

      You can use the `.has-error`, `.has-warning` or `.has-success` classes to send feedback to the user.

      HTML5 input types: `text`, `password`, `datetime`, `datetime-local`, `date`, `month`, `time`, `week`, `number`, `email`, `url`, `search`, `tel`, and `color`

      A drop down list box allows the user to select an item from a predefined list. This list appears in a menu after the element has been clicked on. After the selection has been made, the result is displayed.

      With more than 10 options in the select, a search field is setup at the top of the dropdown list.

      You can also add the `multiple` attribute to `<select>` and allow the user to select more than one option at a time, displaying them as tags in the input field.

      A differentiation is made between primary and secondary buttons. The primary button is used for the main action (e.g. send), which can also be activated via the Enter key. The secondary button is used for less important actions, such as "Cancel".

      The standard button can be used for a variety of actions. Buttons can also be grouped in a button group. As with the radio button groups, only one element can be selected within such a group.

      Use the class `.btn` to create a styled button. You can use it on a `<input>`, `<button>` or `<a>` element. There are 4 button themes:

      The designation of a website allows the user to recognize at a glance who the originator of the site is together with the website's content and purpose.

      The designation consists of the Confederation logo (coat of arms and the four-language wordmark) and the name of the organizational unit, including its abbreviation (e.g. EDA), or as a short form (e.g. MeteoSchweiz).

      These two components are separated from one another by a vertical line. For smartphones only the coat of arms from the Confederation logo is used in the header. The name of the organizational unit can be abbreviated. The appropriate HTML code for this is provided together with the Globalnavigation.

      The full form of the Confederation logo is given in the Footer.

      The logo is a CD element. Its use is mandatory, and its representation may not be changed in any way.

      The predefined color range is intended to make the family of Confederation websites instantly recognizable, to emphasize individual elements and interactions, and is also used for orientation purposes. The color range employed is a CD element, and its use is mandatory.

      Three colors are used: the red shade of the Confederation logo, which is complemented by a lighter shade of red, a blue tone, and a range of gray shades.

      The red color is used in the red line which marks the bottom of the header, and it is also used to indicate a selection in the navigation as well as for mouseovers on links. Otherwise, various shades of gray are used. For instance, the headlines and the body copy are presented in a dark shade of gray.

      If the element should be readable by a screen reader and/or is semantically important, be sure to add the appropriate `aria-` attribute. Otherwise, add an `aria-hidden="true"` attribute to hide it and avoid useless clutter of informations.

      You could also add a `<span class="sr-only">icon description</span>` depending on your needs.
