      You can use `.form-horizontal` on `<form>` to display the label aligned at the left of the input. `.form-group` then behaves like a `.row`.

      Input boxes allow the user to input content (e.g. name).
      For inputting dates, an HTML5 solution is available. With browsers that do not support HTML5 the date has to be input manually.
      The following has to be taken into account for barrier-free accessibility:
      The name of the form and the form box must be linked to a label. A label ID may only appear once on a page. Required fields must have sensible names or, preferably, use WAI.

      You can use the `.has-error`, `.has-warning` or `.has-success` classes to send feedback to the user.

      HTML5 input types: `text`, `password`, `datetime`, `datetime-local`, `date`, `month`, `time`, `week`, `number`, `email`, `url`, `search`, `tel`, and `color`
