      You can use `.form-horizontal` on `<form>` to display the label aligned at the left of the input. `.form-group` then behaves like a `.row`.

      Input boxes allow the user to input content (e.g. name).
      For inputting dates, an HTML5 solution is available. With browsers that do not support HTML5 the date has to be input manually.
      The following has to be taken into account for barrier-free accessibility:
      The name of the form and the form box must be linked to a label. A label ID may only appear once on a page. Required fields must have sensible names or, preferably, use WAI.

      You can use the `.has-error`, `.has-warning` or `.has-success` classes to send feedback to the user.

      HTML5 input types: `text`, `password`, `datetime`, `datetime-local`, `date`, `month`, `time`, `week`, `number`, `email`, `url`, `search`, `tel`, and `color`

      A drop down list box allows the user to select an item from a predefined list. This list appears in a menu after the element has been clicked on. After the selection has been made, the result is displayed.

      With more than 10 options in the select, a search field is setup at the top of the dropdown list.

      You can also add the `multiple` attribute to `<select>` and allow the user to select more than one option at a time, displaying them as tags in the input field.
